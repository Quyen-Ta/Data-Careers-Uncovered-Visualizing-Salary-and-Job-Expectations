# Data Careers Uncovered: Visualizing Salary and Job Expectations 

## Project Overview
The project aims to explore and visualize insights from a survey of over 600 professionals working in the field of data. 
The survey collected responses from data professionals worldwide, covering various aspects of their careers and job satisfaction. 

## Tools Used
- PowerBI: Used for data visualization and interactive exploration of survey insights.
- Power Query: Utilized within PowerBI for data cleaning and preparation.

## Data Sources
The main data source for this project is a survey conducted by the YouTube channel Alex the Analyst
The survey collected information related to job titles, salaries, favorite programming languages, job satisfaction in terms of various aspects (such as salary, work-life balance, learning opprtunities) and career expectations. 

## Data Visualizations
The heart of this project lies in the interactive and insightful data visualizations created using PowerBI. The visualizations cover various aspects of the survey, including salary by job title, favorite programming languages, job satisfaction levels and career expectations.
Due to PowerBI's restriction on public sharing, I have included a screenshot showcasing the visualizations below
